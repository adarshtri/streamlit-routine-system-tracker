    '''A personal echo chamber for positive reinforcement. 
    This project is about creating a space where the thoughts 
    I want to internalize—like 'I'm a great flyer'—are echoed back to me. 
    Just as social echo chambers reinforce beliefs through repetition, 
    this is a deliberate effort to shape my mindset in a way that supports confidence, 
    growth, and well-being.
